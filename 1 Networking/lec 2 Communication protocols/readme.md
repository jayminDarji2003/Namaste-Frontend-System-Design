## HTTP

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

- HTTP protocol defines a path between client and server (sender and receiver) and if the path successful made they can send or receive data.

## HTTPS

- HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

- It's not a separate protocol from HTTP, but it's the more secure and confidential version of it. It's the safest way to transfer data between a browser and a server.

- Most websites nowadays use HTTPS over HTTP. So before submitting any sensitive information like logging into your bank account and making financial transactions, always make sure the site uses HTTPS.

- Each data packet sent over an HTTPS connection is encrypted and secure, using cryptographic protocols such as TLS or SSL, on top of HTTP.
