- When you type any URL to your browser, ex : www.google.com , it is not understand by server. Server have IP Address. We need IP Address to reach to server.
- Now the thing is how we know that what is the IP Address of URL we entered in the browser. When we hit enter the request goes to DNS server (Domain Name Server).
- DNS server give you IP Address of www.google.com => 216.58.216.164
- Now we get the actual IP Address now we can access the server.
- Now we send request to server and get the data in response.
- Response will be html, css, js, image files.
